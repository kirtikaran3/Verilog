      Number using O5 and O6:                    1
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  19,000    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     1 out of  15,850    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:            2
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             2 out of       2  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of       2    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of       2    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of 126,800    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
