WARNING:Xst:905 - "master_in_dual_fsm.v" line 353: One or more signals are missing in the sensitivity list of always block. To enable synthesis of FPGA/CPLD hardware, XST will assume that all necessary signals are present in the sensitivity list. Please note that the result of the synthesis may differ from the initial design specification. The missing signals are:
   <reset>, <arb_control>, <A>, <D>, <C>, <E>
Module <master_control22> is correct for synthesis.
